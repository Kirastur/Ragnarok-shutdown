# Welcome to the Ragnarök configuration settings

# Please contact us at discord if you have any questions

#

general:

  # Should Ragnarök exposes its API to other plugins
  #
  # - If enabled, other Plugins can get an API object by using
  # -  "RagnarokAPI ragnarokAPI = RagnarokProvider.getAPI();"
  enable-api: false


protection:

  # - To lure out Ragnarök at least one player with the
  # - named permission must stay in the named WorlGuard region
  # - when the Ragnerök-command is executed.
  # -
  # - If this fails, nothing happens
  
  # - The Region must be defined in WorldGuard.
  # - The flags of the region do not matter (e.g. passthrough).   
  region: ragnarok
  
  # - Permission check is done by regular mincecraft permisson system.
  # - The permission name also is hard coded in plugin.yml
  # - so please change it here only if you know what you are doing.
  permission: ragnarök.acolyte
